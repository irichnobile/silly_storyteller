//  
//  Program_description: this program generates interactive stories. It begins by
//  asking the user a number of personal questions. After obtaining a sufficient 
//  amount of information, this program outputs a short story of at least one 
//  paragraph that incorporates the userâ€™s personal information obtained via the 
//  initial questioning. The generated story is different every time the program 
//  is run (randomly generating alternative endings, randomly selecting different 
//  descriptions of objects (blue car, green car, red car), etc. This program 
//  makes use of pointers and arrays to deal with strings.
